## Media Found
Total images: 22

## Hypothesis
Based on file size and order:
- `image1.png` -> Likely the Main Coat of Arms (Escudo).
- `image2.png` -> Likely the Concejo Logo.
- `image3-22.png` -> Signatures, footer icons, or embedded diagrams.

## Action Plan
1. Use `image1.png` as the primary header asset.
2. Use `image2.png` as the secondary header asset.
3. Validate positions by generating a test DOCX.
