# ACTAGEN Iterations: Observations from Ruth Navarro

## Iteration 1: Formatting & Typography
- **Citations:** Must be 1 point smaller than body text (Arial 11 if body is 12).
- **Speaker Changes:** Double space (two line breaks) when changing speakers.
- **Paragraphs:** Avoid "brick paragraphs" (walls of text). Split them if possible for readability.
- **Acronyms:** If > 4 letters, use Title Case (e.g., "Isvimed"), not ALL CAPS ("ISVIMED").
- **Consistency:** Ensure font size doesn't change unexpectedly at the end of the document.
- **Bolding:** Avoid bold text in interventions (use sparingly or not at all).

## Iteration 2: Name & Identity Verification
- **Cross-Reference:** Compare names across drafts (Borrador 1 vs. Borrador 2).
- **Sources:** If in doubt:
    1. Search the Internet.
    2. Check the "Session Folder" for the document with the list of invited speakers/intervenants.
- **Consistency:** Use the same spelling for the same person throughout the entire document.
- **Key Figures:** Recognize recurring figures like "Eugenio Abad Ramírez Aristizábal" (Veedor de movilidad).

## Iteration 3: Content Enrichment & Relevance
- **Roles/Charges:** If a speaker's role is missing in one part but mentioned in another (or in a previous draft), complement it.
- **Relevance:** Remove redundant phrases like "The President gives the floor to..." if it's already clear from the section header (e.g., "Interventions of Guests").
- **Annexes:** Verify that read communications and propositions are actually in the annexes.

## Iteration 4: Error Correction & Quality Control
- **Stray Letters:** Watch out for "letritas que sobran" (single letters or artifacts left by AI transcription or processing).
- **Transcription Logic:** Check for context errors (e.g., "viven caminando" vs. "vienen caminando"). 
- **Verification Tooling:** Link segments to YouTube timestamps for quick manual verification (intuition-based).
- **Image Placement:** Images must go *behind the text* so they don't shift paragraphs when editing.

## Iteration 5: Agentic Behavior (Clawdbot/Talleyrand)
- **Reference Points:** Explain "chunks" or reference tokens to users so they don't mistake them for errors.
- **Draft Synthesis:** Automatically pull speaker roles from earlier sections to fill gaps in later sections.
- **Validation:** Proactively flag acronyms > 4 letters in caps.
